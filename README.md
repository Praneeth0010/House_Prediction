# House_Prediction

This project, **House Price Prediction**, demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to predict the selling price of a house using historical housing data. The core of the project is contained in a Jupyter Notebook (`House_Prediction.ipynb`), where the full pipeline is implemented starting with data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Important housing features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and price per square foot are analyzed to understand their impact on house pricing. Various visualizations are used to spot patterns, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.

After data preparation, the project explores several machine learning models, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**, and **Random Forest Regressor**. Each model is trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and the **RÂ² Score**, which helps in measuring the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. The model with the best performance can then be used to make price predictions on new or unseen data.

This notebook is designed for students, beginners in data science, or anyone interested in predictive modeling with structured data. It runs seamlessly in Google Colab, making it easy to access and modify without any complex setup. Users simply need to install common Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` to follow along.

Overall, the project not only highlights the process of building a regression model but also teaches how to interpret model results and gain insights into what factors most influence house prices which can be useful in real estate, urban planning, or investment analysis.
